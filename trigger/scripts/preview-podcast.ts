## AI accelerator export rules
According to Reuters, several governments tightened rules on exporting advanced AI accelerators over the last 7 days, introducing a new licensing tier for chips above a set performance threshold. The Financial Times reports that at least two major manufacturers will adjust their product lines for affected markets, touching a multi-billion-dollar slice of annual sales, though enforcement timelines remain unclear.

## Fusion energy milestone
Nature reports that a research consortium sustained a net-energy-positive fusion reaction for a record duration in tests over the last 30 days, crediting improved magnetic confinement and a new fuel-pellet design. Independent reviewers stress it is a laboratory milestone rather than a path to grid power, with commercial timelines likely a decade or more away.

## Open-weights model release
VentureBeat reports that an AI lab released a new open-weights model in the last 24 hours, claiming parity with larger proprietary systems on several reasoning benchmarks while running on consumer hardware. Early testers note strong coding performance but mixed results on long-context tasks; the permissive license allows commercial use.
